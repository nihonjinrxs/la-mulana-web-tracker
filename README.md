# la-mulana-web-tracker
A web-based tracker for La Mulana Randomizer by ZoeVermilion.

This tracker is meant to be an alternative to the Windows-only auto-tracker for use on any operating system via your web browser.

You can use the tracker without downloading here: https://zoctobere.github.io/la-mulana-web-tracker/

Base code adapted from Starisms' Legend of Zelda Location Tracker. A huge thanks to them for their help in getting this project started.
