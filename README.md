# la-mulana-web-tracker
A web-based tracker for La Mulana Randomizer by ZoeVermilion.

Lots of code adapted from allibear17's Legend of Zelda Location Tracker (https://github.com/allibear17/Legend-of-Zelda-Location-Tracker)

This tracker is meant to be an alternative to the Windows-only auto-tracker for use on any operating system via your web browser.

You can use the tracker without downloading here: https://zoctobere.github.io/la-mulana-web-tracker/
